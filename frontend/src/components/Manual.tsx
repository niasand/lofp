                Welcome to the Shattered Realms! A place of art and science,
                wizards and warriors, beauty and romance, magic and technology,
                mutants and monsters.
              </p>
              <p>
                Andor is our planet, a small part of which makes up the Shattered
                Realms. Around us is a vast desert wasteland, the legacy of an
                ancient Cataclysm that destroyed the once highly technological
                society that thrived here.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the Realms, life has taken hold again. You live in the City of
                Fayd, an old metropolis predating the Cataclysm. There are many
                ancient places here including catacombs beneath the city itself, and
                vast subterranean areas far beneath the surface.
              </p>
              <p>
                To the north lies a great range of mountains known as the
                Teeth of Shartan, it too, is honeycombed with caves. Rolling hills
                and grassy plains, as well as the great Inner Sea, lay to the east
                and south. The great forest of Grymwood stands to the west. Only the
                dangerous and forbidding Great Waste lies beyond these borders.
              </p>
              <p>
                A variety of creatures populate the Shattered Realms. The most
                common is the elder race: humans. Their forefathers lived alone in
                the pre-Cataclysmic world. Now, humans share the world with the
                aelfen of the forests, the highlanders of the mountain, the murg
                of the caves, and the drakin of the skies. In addition, you will
                meet wolflings, a race of shape changers that can assume human or
                wolf form; ephemerals, a race of noncorporeal entities and their
                relatives the mechanoids, a race of robots imbued with a spirit.
                You may even encounter those with the arcane knowledge of becoming
                a vampire. Besides these, the world is rich in flora and fauna;
                thousands of creatures, both good and evil, beautiful and monstrous,
                inhabit the land.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Realms are rich in magic, the existence of which became known
                at the time of the Change. Sorcerers everywhere ply their mystic
                talents in four basic schools: druidic, enchantment, necromancy and
                conjuration. Others delve into history to find the clues that would
                allow them to understand the most ancient of all magic &mdash; technology.
              </p>
              <p>
                Cybernetics, formerly a lost science, has regained popularity,
                since it provides humans with an improvement over biology.
                Psionics, the methodology of mind over matter, has also come to the
                fore, as those with great force of will seek to bend nature to
                their course.

                Fayd is built within the walls of an ancient, pre-cataclysmic
                city now surrounded by rolling hills and grasslands on all sides.
                The Teeth of Shartan, a great mountain range, lies to the north.
                Some say it is the location of the lost city of Mirdaal. Northwest
                is the dense Grymwood forest. To the south are the Inner
                Sea, the entrance to mysterious caverns and the wasteland.
                Beyond these, nothing more is known to the people of the
                Realms, since it is several hundred leagues inland from an ocean
                and twice as far from another city-state. Fayd is ruled by a town
                government of appointed and elected officials who run the day to
                day mercantile and law-enforcement operations. The Royal Government
                creates new laws and declares war.

              History
            </h3>
            <div className="text-gray-300 space-y-3 leading-relaxed">
              <p>
                According to the teachings of the oral historians, just over
                a millennium ago, the planet of Andor was a much different place.
                Desert was almost nonexistent, and humans were the only intelligent
                race to walk the land. Humankind developed great sciences,
                engineering the means to improve body and mind. It is said that
                they built ships that could sail away from Andor and into the stars.
              </p>
              <p>
                All this came to an end following a terrible event known as
                the Cataclysm. Oral history chronicles the horror of fiery rocks
                streaming from the heavens, pummeling the land and destroying much
                of the surface of the world. It also tells of Andorans who knew
                what was coming and prepared. A tale is told of a chosen few, who
                escaped the planet on silvery starships. Nothing has been learned
                of what became of these people. There are rumors that others built
                great complexes beneath the ground in which they remained safe from
                the destruction. Most unfortunate Andorans simply took shelter in
                the surface cities, few survived.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Cataclysm tore the world apart, and chaos spread like wildfire.
                Soon, armies of men formed, and within the span of a decade, a
                hundred wars were fought to control what remained. Epidemics of
                conflict spread untold destruction across the land. Eventually, the
                tattered remnants of mankind lacked either the willpower or the
                means to continue their internecine conflict. Indeed, there was
                little to fight over. Then, the Change occurred. No one knew what
                caused the Change. Some say it was material that fell from the sky
                at the onset of the Cataclysm. Others blame the terrible weapons
                used by the humans in their wars. The religious often feel that the
                massive death toll released fundamental energies into the world.
                Maybe it was all three of these or none.
              </p>
              <p>
                During the Change, oral historians tell us some life forms
                remained the same while others experienced millions of years of
                evolution in a single century. It was this acceleration that
                created the new races now sharing the Realms with humans and
                animals. At the same time, the Change awoke untapped powers in all
                the people of the Realms. Some learned to channel the energy of
                the mind to perform feats of destruction. Others found they could
                touch upon the primal forces of the universe and bend the physical
                laws to their own will.
              </p>
              <p>
                For many centuries after the Cataclysm and the Change, Andor was in
                a great dark age. The works of the Elder Humans were lost. All that
                is known and believed today has been passed down in the prose of
                oral historians. The scattered remnants of mankind and their new
                neighbors struggled to relearn the basics of civilization such as
                farming, domesticating livestock and building simple communities.
                However, parts of pre-cataclysmic Fayd and other structures remain,
                standing like grim monuments of the past. Such places were viewed
                with fear and few were daring enough to explore them. These early
                years were dangerous, and the people were ripe for the conquering
                by powerful users of magic. The most noteworthy figure in the
                history of early Fayd is the tale of the dread necromancer
                Malthesia. In the year 424, he came across the Great Waste and
                arrived in Fayd with great riches and powerful artifacts. None knew
                of his true origins, and none dared to guess how he survived a
                trek across the Waste alone. Using magic and his wealth, he
                constructed a keep which was completed as soon as 426. Many spoke
                of horrible experiments Malthesia was perpetrating within his keep,
                and some accused him of summoning demons and creating undead
                horrors. Yet these voices were stifled and ignored, and in the year
                427 a host of evil fell upon the city of Fayd. After two weeks of
                brutal slaughter, the tales speak of how the great warrior, Orlin
                Thinvar, set out with his magic sword Sunstrike, and penetrated the
                keep to confront the Necromancer. No one knows how the battle went,
                but as the night approached, an inhuman roar emanated from the Keep
                that shook the very foundations of Fayd, and Malthesia&apos;s demonic
                generals were sent back to whence they came. Today, a sickly green
                mist still surrounds the Keep, preventing entry, but the
                Necromancer is no more.
              </p>
              <p>
                The first exploration into the ancient lore of technology occurred
                just two hundred and fifty years ago and ended in disaster and
                bloodshed. Alkaryn, a great warlord, discovered a huge cache of
                powerful, ancient weapons in an area near the city. He swiftly
                used them to forge a vast empire, which he ruled with an iron fist.
                Within a few years however, rebellions sprang up across his domain.
                Many of his foe sought the ancient technologies in order to counter
                Alkaryn. This culminated in the Great Technomancy War of 783, and
                lead to the deaths of tens of thousands. The war resulted in the
                eradication of most of the ancient technology as well as the
                displacement of millions.
              </p>
              <p>
                The mechanoid race came to be around this time. They originated as
                ephemerals, who for the purpose of battling technology, took on
                mechanical form. During the many years of the war, their leaders
                too were destroyed. The secrets of mechanoid technology were lost.
                Today&apos;s mechanoids can replicate the original patterns to create
                new members of their race, but they cannot improve upon or
                add to their technology. Thus the mechanoid race, the greatest
                legacy of the war and a seeming anomaly in the Realms, cannot be
                understood even by themselves. Alkaryn was finally repulsed when
                the emperor Regulus rose to power in 789. Regulus united the
                fractured rebel forces against Alkaryn, and swept his armies from
                Fayd. Regulus himself was known to have used great weapons of mass
                destruction, but they were never seen again after these last
                battles.
              </p>
              <p>
                With the overthrow of Alkaryn, people expected a happier
                life, however, Regulus proved to a cruel dictator who would stand
                for no resistance and no inefficiency. Those who were not deemed
                worthy members of the society were eliminated with a wave of a
                hand. Regulus&apos; previous allies slowly turned against him. His end
                came upon his confrontation with the young warrior-wizard, Frederick
                in 795.
              </p>
              <p>
                Frederick used spells of great power and ejected Regulus from Fayd.
                Regulus has not been seen since. King Frederick was said to be kind
                and just, and his rule is known as the Golden Age of Fayd. He
                retained his youth to an extremely old age. At age 120 (year 902),
                despite his health, he passed the throne to his son, Frederick II.
                Frederick then left for a journey to the Teeth of Shartan from which
                he has not yet returned. Frederick II lived to a similarly old age
                before dying in year 976 and passing the Kingship to Frederick III.
                Frederick III was recently assassinated along with most of his family.
                His son Prince Hadan, now king Hadan, rules Fayd and its surrounding
                area.

                It appears to be a composite of synthetic diamond and titanium
                steel micro filaments. It has strong anti-magic properties.
                Alzyron is so rare that a chest full of the material would easily

                unholy touch of Dahkahn, and is known as Black Truesteel or
                Shadowsteel. Fortunately, normal elkyri can be blessed and
                purified through a long process to produce White Truesteel. Also

                oak. It is hard to come by because there is no easy way to
                identify the exact tree it might exist in. Additionally, most
                aelfen will protect these trees if they learn of them, keeping the
                sites secret. Urimar is found in a clump at the center of a stump
                and has a coloring strange for metal: dark red, olive green or deep
                purple. It is possible to work the substance into superior weapons,
                tools and armor, though it requires a knowledgeable smith. Urimar

              <p>
                The first time you play Legends of Future Past, you will have the
                fun of creating your premier character. We suggest you don&apos;t
                worry about it too much the first time and just create any old
                character. After you tour the Realms for a bit, you can always
                create a new character and you can have up to three characters per
                account.
              </p>
              <p>
                When rolling a character you will be required to choose a full
                name (first and last). You may have up to fifteen letters in each
                one. Punctuation such as hyphens and accents are permitted in your
                last name only. We recommend you choose a name that suits the
                fantasy genre. Legends of Future Past will prompt you for a
                different name if the one you choose is already in use.
              </p>
              <p>
                After choosing a name, you will first decide what race your
                character will belong to, your decision will affect certain special
                abilities and physical attributes. (See People of the Realms)
              </p>
              <p>
                Next, your character&apos;s statistics are generated randomly on a
                one-hundred sided die. After being modified by your chosen race,
                the numbers are displayed and you are queried for approval. You can
                continue to reroll these statistics until you like what you see.
                (See Stats for greater detail about statistics.)
              </p>
              <p>
                Lastly, you will be granted 30 build points to allocate for your
                initial skills. You will be able to learn these skills from guilds,
                organizations and other characters within the City of Fayd. Choose
                wisely, for these abilities will greatly affect your survivability
                as a low-level character and your power later on. Once you have
                made your choice, the decision is final. In the case of a typo,
                you may type ASSIST.

                A number of fascinating races populate the Shattered Realms.
                Each has its own advantages and drawbacks.
              </p>

              <h4 className="text-green-400 font-bold mt-4">Aelfen</h4>
              <p>
                The aelfen are tall, slender humanoids that could be mistaken
                for humans at a distance. However, their pretty features and
                pointed ears give them away as one draws closer. The aelfen are
                quick, agile and have heightened senses from living in the
                woodlands. They may live for centuries and are extremely resistant
                to natural diseases. Aelfen have the power to <span className="text-amber-300">CALL</span> a woodland
                creature to serve them. This works only in wilderness. The aelfen
                are carefree and aloof with mercurial tempers. They are quick to
                love or hate, but they almost never hold a grudge. They dislike
                violence but are prepared to do what they must in times of need.
                They are lovers of beauty and the arts and they usually adore
                magic. They dislike murg who they find ugly, crude and wasteful of
                natural resources. They also distrust drakin, because they too
                seem ugly to them.
              </p>

              <h4 className="text-green-400 font-bold mt-4">Drakin</h4>
              <p>
                Also known as dragon-men, drakin are humanoids covered with tough
                scales. They have powerful jaws, reptilian tails and large bat-like
                wings that allow them to <span className="text-amber-300">FLY</span>. Many people have made the mistake of
                thinking the drakin to be slow &mdash; they move little unless they need
                to &mdash; and learned too late that drakin can move with lightning
                speed when necessary. The drakin culture has developed its own
                school of fighting, employing techniques that differ from the
                fighting styles of any other in the land. This caused the drakin
                to invent new weapons specifically designed to work well with their
                fighting style. They are generous with their knowledge, and anyone
                can learn drakin weapons. Drakin weaponry includes the katana,
                wakizashi, sai, kusari-gama, nunchaku, bo-stick, naginata and
                shuriken. Drakin style may be combined with two weapon fighting.
                Drakin never wear armor and great swings in temperature are more
                deadly to them than other races. The common speech of the Realms
                is difficult for drakin, so they avoid speaking altogether. When
                they have something to say it is usually important or wise. They
                are highly aggressive, but battles between one drakin and another
                outside of tournaments are nearly unheard of. In fact, should one
                drakin dare to threaten another with physical harm, that individual
                may be subject to excommunication from their race. The drakin have a
                rich history of ancestor worship.
              </p>

              <h4 className="text-green-400 font-bold mt-4">Ephemeral</h4>
              <p>
                Mystery shrouds the origin of the ephemeral race. Described as
                phantoms, ephemerals are wispy apparitions of human-like people.
                They do not exist completely in the physical plane. As a result,
                non-magical weapons do not harm them except when they themselves
                go on the offense with weapons, magic or psionics. This draws
                them onto the physical plane and causes them to become vulnerable
                to mundane attacks. Still, they do not bleed. Because they only
                have semi-substance, they cannot manipulate objects that weigh more
                than a couple of pounds. Ephemerals can see well in the dark.
                Besides being able to speak, they are also natural telepaths.
                Ephemerals are not a violent people and usually devote their lives
                to scholarly pursuits. They regard mechanoids coldly for forsaking
                their existence as ephemerals.
              </p>

              <h4 className="text-green-400 font-bold mt-4">Highlander</h4>
              <p>
                The highlanders are short and rugged people who live in and on the
                mountains. Like murg, they can see well in darkness. They are
                strong, enduring and are especially resistant to magic. Similarly,
                magic is not easy for them to use. On the other hand, they are
                very comfortable with technological implements and devices. Known
                as Children of the Stone, highlanders wield special powers over the
                elements of earth. When in caves, they employ a chameleon-like
                power. When they <span className="text-amber-300">BLEND</span> into the rocks around them, they become
                harder to attack. At fifth level they gain the ability to hold a
                gemstone of any sort in their hands and <span className="text-amber-300">MOLD</span> it into a more
                valuable gem. Occasionally this backfires and ruins a gem.
                Highlanders are a robust people who often make good fighters and
                psionicists. Their women can be quite attractive contrary to the
                jokes made about them, and they certainly do not have beards.
              </p>

              <h4 className="text-green-400 font-bold mt-4">Mechanoid</h4>
              <p>
                The roots of the mechanoid race originate in the Great Technomancy
                War of 783, when a group of ephemerals fighting for survival sought
                a more substantial and robust existence by constructing robotic
                housings for their essence. These creatures were the original
                mechanoids: machines imbued with an ephemeral spirit. Regenerating
                living tissue covers their mechanical bodies. Due to the type of
                existence they have chosen, mechanoids are the least empathic of
                all races and thus make the worst spellcasters. However, they can
                turn their emotions on and off at will, thus channeling their
                skills and powers to maximum effectiveness. Mechanoids are often
                seen as cold and unfeeling since they are machines in body, if not
                in spirit. Their ability to turn off emotions does not help this
                image (see <span className="text-amber-300">EMOTE</span> and <span className="text-amber-300">UNEMOTE</span>). They regard other life forms,
                especially true ephemerals, as inferior. They have a tendency to be
                pragmatic and logical to annoyance.
              </p>

              <h4 className="text-green-400 font-bold mt-4">Murg</h4>
              <p>
                Murg are burly humanoids naturally endowed with a desire to
                compete. They are enduring, strong, and vicious warriors. Their
                powerful limbs make them skilled climbers. Their homeland is deep
                in the mountains. Their eyes have gained sensitivity in darkness,
                allowing them to see nearly as well as in daylight, giving birth to
                the expression, &ldquo;I&apos;d sooner meet a murg in a dark alley.&rdquo; Murg can
                enter a state of battle <span className="text-amber-300">FRENZY</span>. This allows them to strike out
                with greater ferocity, but places them at greater risk of becoming
                injured. Further, if they are injured while frenzied, even if that
                injury would normally render them unconscious, they can continue
                to fight on until they literally die standing up. The murg as a
                whole tend to be quarrelsome and crude. They are compulsive
                practical jokers, and they find themselves extremely funny. Don&apos;t
                take an insult from a murg too seriously. Murg are broken up into
                clans that constantly fight each other (even more so than humans
                fight amongst themselves). They believe that exposing themselves

              <h4 className="text-green-400 font-bold mt-4">Wolfling</h4>
              <p>
                Strong humanoids of medium height, wolflings look like humans with
                distinctly lupine features and greater than normal amounts of body
                hair. They can polymorph into a giant wolf (see command <span className="text-amber-300">TRANSFORM</span>).
                They can travel long distances without fatigue and battle using
                their claws and teeth when in wolf form. Wolflings see at night as
                well as in day as long as there is at least starlight. Quickness
                and agility are the hallmarks of a wolfling. Wolflings are a proud,
                noble race. Honor is extremely important to them. Above all else
                they hate comparisons to werewolves (a totally corrupt and cursed
                monster which shares similar abilities). Calling a wolfling a
                werewolf is a dangerous proposition: it could instigate the race
                as a whole to do something to protect the honor and integrity of
                their people. The wolflings have a homeland in the forest and
                frequently go there to leave the bustling city.

              <h4 className="text-green-400 font-bold mt-4">Human</h4>
              <p>
                The elder race of the Shattered Realms, humans have existed since
                time out of mind. They are physically average, but tend to excel at
                any skill they pursue. This is attributed to their superior
                willpower. Cybernetic technology was originally developed for
                humans, so they may employ any such device. There is no easy way
                to describe the personality of humans as a whole. They all act
                differently, but most feel individualism is important. They get
                along with other races as well as they get along with each other:
                humans will battle or befriend others seemingly at random. Humans
                have an extraordinary tendency to fight each other, despite the
                detriment to their race.

                <span className="text-green-400">Strength:</span> Physical muscle power and the ability to make good use of the
                power you have. The stronger you are, the more you can carry and
                lift before you begin to fatigue, also, greater damage you do with
                melee weapons and the more power you can apply in situations such
                as forcing a jammed door open.
              </p>
              <p>
                <span className="text-green-400">Agility:</span> Dexterity, litheness, aim, nimbleness. The more agile you are, the
                greater your ability to perform activities requiring stealth. Agile
                people aim their weapons more precisely and make better climbers.
              </p>
              <p>
                <span className="text-green-400">Quickness:</span> General speed and reaction time. Quick people have a better
                chance of avoiding a trap just as it springs, can move faster,
                dodge attacks better and have shorter round times for physical
                activities.

              <p>
                <span className="text-green-400">Constitution:</span> Physical endurance, health, resistance. Those with high
                constitution are less susceptible to disease and poison. They may
                perform strenuous activity for longer amounts of time without rest,
                and can take more physical damage before collapsing. Constitution
                directly determines how many body points you have, which will
                determine how much harm you can take before dying or going
                unconscious. Lastly, constitution directly affects the amount of
                fatigue points gained when making a level and the rate at which
                fatigue points return.
              </p>
              <p>
                <span className="text-green-400">Perception:</span> This is the measure of how well honed your natural senses are
                and the ability to pick out small details. The greater your
                perception, the higher your chance of avoiding surprise attacks,
                finding hidden objects, locating and disarming traps, finding
                secret portals, etc.

                your physical powers to their limit. Willpower is important in
                performing and resisting psionic attacks. It factors directly into
                how much psi you have, which limits how much psionic power you can

              <p>

                touch upon the fundamental forces of nature with your inner self.
                Empathy allows people to wield the forces of magic, and directly
                factors into how much mana you have, which limits how many spells
                you can cast during a given period.

                You accumulate experience points as you perform skills, defeat

                experience points you gain, based on your level, you receive a
                build point toward purchasing skills and increasing the statistics
                of your character. You gain a level every 10 build points (whether
                you spend those points or not). You may spend build points
                immediately in the middle of your advancement through a level, or
                save them up to acquire costly skills (some skills may require
                several levels to develop). Training after a character reaches
                fourth level costs five gold crowns per training level. Characters

                order to encourage more adventuring, which is both good for the
                economy and protects the city from evil in a cost effective manner.
                The Adventurers&apos; Guild trains in most skills up to level ten. After
                that, those who wish specialized training, must seek it out from
                private sources. There are several organizations and churches to
                choose from. Rank within an organization depends on how much

                Some organizations are open to the public, while others are by

                desire membership in one of these organizations, you should ask
                around and try to find other members of the guild. They will tell
                you what you need to do to become a member. You may be a member of
                only one organization at a time.

                This is a neutral organization of intrepid thrill-seekers and
                treasure-hunters. It offers education in almost every skill,
                though not to a particularly high level in any specific skill.
                Anyone may join the adventurer&apos;s guild, but it is not necessary in

                Situated in a citadel in southwestern Fayd, this organization
                maintains high standards in the arts of combat. The warriors of
                the Crimson Band are feared and respected throughout Fayd.
                Long-time protectors of the Royal family, The Band helps to maintain
                order in and around Fayd, including the apprehension of warranted
                criminals. Membership is by invitation only.

                who study the arts of magic and psionic power. They follow many
                paths and their goals are not known to the world at large. Some
                consider them benign and others malign, but the truth is known

                others are convinced that it is the largest guild in Fayd. Rakes train
                in a swashbuckling style of combat and stealth. The Fellowship has

                cause harm. Their members range from crafts people to warriors
                and spell casters and there is no one set of skills which they
                seek from potential members. They ask only that their hearts
                are true and that they are dedicated to their cause. Their

                the forces of evil and chaos in the world. Membership is by

                membership is predominantly Drakin, but the guild is open to all races.
                The Way guild is neutral in orientation. They strive to maintain harmony
                in all things, but have been known to act as the allies to light or to
                darkness, depending on where the balance lies. Most members of the
                Order worship their Ancestors and the guild scholars have painstakingly
                researched an ancient Drakin language and have documented clan lineage.
                Membership is by invitation only.

                The Physician&apos;s Guild will aid any in need (except undead), but will charge
                a modest fee for salves, splints and bandages. Mental afflictions cannot
                be cured here.

              <h4 className="text-green-400 font-bold mt-4">Technologists</h4>

                The Technologists Guild believes that the future of Fayd lies in the
                return of technology to Andor. They view magic as a backward and an
                evil force which will keep Fayd in the Dark Ages. Through archaeology
                and research they try to uncover technological items and spread the
                influence of science as an alternative to the superstitious practices
                of mages. Their accomplishments include the archaeological dig that
                resulted in the discovery of Fayd&apos;s subway system as well as the

                the exception of the Cult of Dahkahn, they generally coexist in
                peace, though heated theological disputes are common. All teach
                necromancy, however each teaches a different weapon skill. Career

                drives the natural cycle of birth, death and rebirth. Perennial
                disputes arise between the Church of Shemri and the Temple of Rorin
                pertaining to the existence of the vast deserts in the Shattered
                Realms. Followers of Shemri often claim that Rorin is killing the
                world, where the worshippers of Rorin respond that he has not
                forgiven the world yet. Her priests wear ruddy-brown robes and

                people of the Realms. It is a name to strike fear into the heart
                of anyone. Dahkahn is usually referred to by other names: the
                Devourer of Souls, Lifesbane, Lord of the Grave, King of Dread, or
                The Enemy. Those who worship Dahkahn do so in secret, and only for
                the most selfish of reasons. Dahkahn is said to be incredibly cruel
                and demanding of his servants in return for the powers he bestows
                on them. He is recognized by many as the source of all death,
                decay and disease. Membership in Dahkahn is secret and by invitation
                only.

              <h4 className="text-green-400 font-bold mt-4">Temple of Amilor, Lord of the Deep</h4>
              <p>
                Amilor is the god of the waters, emotions and strong
                passion. He is husband to Shemri the earth mother. He is seen as both
                nurturer, bringing warm rains to the earth, and as a destroyer of his
                enemies in a ravaging storm of fury. The church of Amilor is composed
                of the orders of the priests and the knights. Often Amilor&apos;s followers
                are driven by strong passions and can be as mercurial as their god,
                bringing both healing and peace to the land or wreaking terrible
                vengeance on the forces of evil.
              </p>

              <h4 className="text-green-400 font-bold mt-4">Temple of Rorin, the Sun, the Lord of Light</h4>
              <p>
                Rorin lights the day, heats the world, and helps the plants grow,
                yet he is master of the deserts and can burn life away. His
                worshippers seek both to appease his wrath and secure his help in
                making crops prosper. They believe in generational responsibility,
                that the state of the world is what it is because of the sins of
                their ancestors. Rorin&apos;s followers believe that when all people
                of the world acknowledge Rorin as the greatest god, &ldquo;The deserts
                shall be swept away like so much sand from a table, and life shall
                prosper forevermore in the glory of the Lord of Light.&rdquo; Priests of
                Rorin wear bright orange raiment and carry a golden eight-rayed sun
                for a symbol. When depicted in art, Rorin is shown as a sparsely
                dressed man surrounded by swirling flames.

              <SkillEntry name="Alchemy" cost="15/5">
                This skill enables the character to create potions. Potions are formed
                by mixing alchemical reagents. These reagents may be actual chemical
                compounds, or they may be certain magical herbs or other organic byproducts.
                It is up to the alchemist to learn what substances have magical
                properties and what substances can be combined to form useful potions.
                Each level of skill in Alchemy allows the creation of increasingly
                powerful potions. Creating a potion requires that three reagents be combined,
                plus some sort of liquid container (such as a flask). Each type of reagent
                contains one specific type of &ldquo;essence.&rdquo; You ALWAYS will need at least one
                reagent that is a catalyst. Mandrake root is a well-known but weak catalyst.

              Combat
            </h2>
            <div className="text-gray-300 space-y-3 leading-relaxed">
              <p>
                Success in battle is determined by a myriad of variables.
                All your statistics, skill, weapon type, armor, weather, visibility,
                lighting, terrain, range and other values factor in.
              </p>
              <p>
                When an attack is made, the system calculates your To Hit value. You
                must roll over that number on a d100 to score a hit. The
                minimum To Hit is always 5 (always a chance to miss) and the maximum
                is 95 (always a slight chance to hit).
              </p>
              <p>
                Damage is based on the weapon you wield. High strength increases melee
                and polearm damage. High agility increases damage from bows and thrown weapons.
              </p>
              <p>
                Melee attacks cause fatigue loss. The amount depends on equipment weight
                relative to your strength and constitution. At half fatigue, a -10 To Hit
                penalty is imposed; at quarter fatigue, a -25 penalty. Missile and Thrown
                Weapons do not use fatigue.
              </p>
              <p>
                Psionics and magic do not require a To Hit roll. Instead, the target gets
                a chance to resist based on their statistics.
              </p>
              <p>
                <span className="text-green-400">Weapon Specialization:</span> After training to 10th level in a weapon category,
                you may specialize in a specific weapon. Each rank increases vital area
                hit chance by 15%, max 75% (5 ranks max). First rank costs 10 build points;
                additional ranks cost 5 each. Max 5 different weapon specializations.
              </p>
              <p>
                Stronger hits may cause wounds: lacerations, gashes, etc. Bleeding wounds
                drain body points until healed. Rolls over 95 may stun (-20 defense) or
                knock you down (-50 defense).
              </p>
              <p>
                <span className="text-green-400">Weapon Clash:</span> On attack rolls less than 3, weapons can be damaged
                in a &ldquo;weapon clash.&rdquo; The chance is based on a 2d100 roll versus weapon strength
                (material, size, power). Damaged weapons have a -10 ToHit penalty and can
                be repaired by a weaponsmith. A damaged weapon that encounters another clash
                will break permanently!
              </p>
              <p>
                To engage in melee, <span className="text-amber-300">ADVANCE</span> towards the target. To disengage, <span className="text-amber-300">RETREAT</span>.

              <p>
                Wearing armor reduces damage from attacks. Heavier armor provides
                more protection but causes higher fatigue rates. Different armors
                protect against certain attacks better than others: plate armor is
                not nearly as effective against crushing weapons as it is against
                slashing. Some races have natural armor that improves with level.
                All armor other than leather detrimentally affects spellcasting.

                If you drop below 0 body points, you are unconscious. You may drift
                in and out of consciousness and can potentially be healed or eat
                babich root when you come to. After a while, you may die or receive
                a coup de grace. Someone with Breath of Life can restore you.

                (new citizens begin with five free treatments). Biological forms are
                cloned; ephemerals are reintegrated; mechanoids are repaired. Your
                possessions are returned.
              </p>
              <p>
                Death results in loss of up to 90% of experience towards your next
                build point. This is softened to 20% if resurrected with Breath of Life.
                Some dangerous areas cannot be departed from. The Deep Realms require
                different insurance payments.

                There are four schools of magic: <span className="text-green-400">Enchantment</span>, <span className="text-green-400">Necromancy</span>,
                {' '}<span className="text-green-400">Druidic</span> and <span className="text-green-400">Conjuration</span>.
              </p>
              <p>
                To know a spell of a certain level, you must be trained to at least
                that level in the appropriate school. Simply training in a school does
                not teach you spells &mdash; they must be found on scrolls or taught by others.
              </p>
              <p>
                Casting costs mana equal to the spell&apos;s level. Your base invocation success
                is 25% + 10% of empathy score, +5% per level of Spellcraft (max 95%).
                A failed roll fizzles; a roll over 98% is a fumble with harmful side-effects;
                a roll of 2% or below is a spectacular success (double effect).

                additional ranks cost 4 each. Each rank increases damage/duration proportionally
                and reduces mana cost by 2 (min half original cost). Prerequisite: spellcraft
                level must be at least twice the spell&apos;s level. Mastery bonuses do not apply
                under time-altering spells (Haste, Slow).

              The Art of Roleplaying

              <p>
                Legends of Future Past is, first and foremost, a roleplaying game. While
                many people play this game for a variety of reasons, the essence of the game is
                grounded in roleplaying. Roleplaying is like acting. Your ability to roleplay
                will develop in time, and is very important to the &ldquo;suspension of disbelief&rdquo;
                within the game. The better a group of roleplayers, the more believable and
                enjoyable the game will be.
              </p>
              <p>
                The first part of roleplaying a character is to make the character as
                detailed as possible in history, beliefs, motivations, and personal behavior.
                You have to decide who and what your character is. You may want to base your
                character upon a fictional literary character, with some alterations for
                originality. Whatever you decide, be consistent. It is very disconcerting for
                other players if your behavior changes from day to day.
              </p>
              <p>
                When you are in the game, it is important to act consistently within the
                beliefs of your CHARACTER, not necessarily yourself. This is called staying
                IC (In Character). While OOC (Out of Character) conversation goes on amongst
                friends, there is an appropriate time and place for it. In general, when in a
                group you don&apos;t know well, it enhances the atmosphere if you avoid open OOC talk.
              </p>
              <p>
                <span className="text-green-400">What constitutes OOC behavior?</span> Try to put yourself into the world of Andor.
                Would your character have this knowledge? Would they really say these things
                if this world were real? Avoid using game mechanics to cheat or give your
                character knowledge they would not have.
              </p>
              <p>
                Communicate to the game masters via feedback some information about your
                character, as well as what you would like to see happen. Provide a backstory,
                motivations, and goals. The GMs want to entertain you and tell good stories &mdash;
                if you come up with one, they will be more than willing to help.

                <p>
                  If you find yourself in player vs. player combat, DO NOT disconnect to avoid
                  death. Doing so will result in a warning; repeated offenses may lead to account
                  suspension.

                <p>
                  Taking advantage of bugs that directly help your character will result in
                  suspension. Report bugs via ASSIST or REPORT &mdash; you may receive experience
                  points as a reward. Lying to a Game Master is also considered cheating.

                <p>
                  Treat everyone with respect. Continuous harassment will result in penalties.

                  Players under tenth level operate under protected status. They are not to be
                  killed, searched, stolen from or otherwise harassed.

                  Sexual harassment is seriously frowned upon and will be severely dealt with
                  by the staff. If someone is harassing you, please ASSIST and talk to a
                  Game Master.
